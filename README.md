# Reddit saved filter

This project allows a user to search/filter their saved items from reddit.
The frontend is made using React (hosted on Vercel at [reddit-saved-filter](https://reddit-saved-filter.vercel.app/)) and the backend consists of the reddit API itself.

An example of the app flow is shown below (oAuth).
