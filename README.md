# Reddit saved filter

This project allows a user to search/filter their saved items from reddit, the items themselves are categorised per subreddit. 
The frontend is made using React (hosted on Vercel at [reddit-saved-filter](https://reddit-saved-filter.vercel.app/)) 
and the backend consists of the reddit API itself (oauth2).

An example of the app flow is shown below.
